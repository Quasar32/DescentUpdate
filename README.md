Style Guide:
    Naming Convention:
        Functions and variables:
           Functions and Variables are named in uppercase CamelCase 
        Macros:
            Macros are named in full uppercase SNAKE_CASE
        Types (structs, union, typedefs):
            Types are named in lowercase snake_case
    Shared Naming Convention:
        Functions and variables shared between layers:
            Functions and variables shared between layers should be prefixed 
            with their layer prefix while mantaining uppercase CamelCase. 
            Ex: Prefix + FuncName -> PrefixFuncName 
        Macros:
            Macros shared between layers should be prefixed with their layer 
            prefix while mantaining full uppercase SNAKE_CASE.
            Ex: PREFIX + TYPE_NAME -> PREFIX_TYPE_NAME 
        Types shared between layers:
            Types shared between layers should be prefixed with their layer 
            prefix while mantaining lowercase snake_case.
            Ex: prefix + type_name -> prefix_type_name 
    Indentation: 
        Code uses four spaces for indentation; tabs are not allowed! 
    Line Limit: 
        The limit of length of line is 80-chars. 
        Long argument list are broken up as if a series of statements in
        a block.

        Ex 1. of breaking line: 
            Func(A, B, C, D) becomes
            Function(
                A,
                B,
                C,
                D
            )

        Ex 2. of breaking line: 
            int Func(int A, int B, int C, int D) becomes 
            int Func(
                int A, 
                int B,
                int C,
                int D
            )
    Line Endings:
        All lines end with UNIX line endings in online repository.
    Attributes:
        Both GCC (__atttribute__) and C2X attributes ([[]]) are to be put on
        the line before the return type. If both are used C2X attributes come
        second. 
    Documentation:
        When written documentation should be written in Linux kernel style 
    C Standard:
        All C2X compatible features are allowed 
Conventions:
    On passing an array as a parameter 
        Static array indices should be used to indicate the size of the array passed 
        Example:
            int Func(int Array[static 4]);
        Previous parameter should be element count if not element count is dynamic 
        Example:
            int Func(size_t Count, int Array[static Count]);
Build:
    Currently, the game build is two unities build, one for the platform layer and
    the other for the platform independent code.
